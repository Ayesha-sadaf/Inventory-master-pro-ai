## üí° How It Works
Scraping & Data Processing: Inventory data is scraped and cleaned into JSON files.

Vector Store Indexing: Data is embedded and indexed into ChromaDB for fast retrieval.

RAG Pipeline: embedded user queries are matched with relevant data chunks, then processed with an AI model.

Streaming Responses: Responses are sent to users in real-time via Chainlit interface.

```

**Run Locally**
```
chainlit run app.py -w
```
**Scraper**
The **Scraper Module** allows you to **scrape data from any website** and convert it into a structured JSON format suitable for AI processing. By modifying the target URL(s) and specifying the relevant HTML selectors, you can extract:

- Text content  
- Headings & subheadings  
- Paragraphs and lists  
- Metadata like URLs and timestamps  

## How It Works

1. **Specify Target URLs:** Add the websites you want to scrape in the script or a config file.  
2. **Define Selectors:** Adjust the scraping logic to capture the relevant content, e.g., headings, paragraphs, or specific HTML elements.  
3. **Run Scraper:** Execute the `scraper.py` script to fetch content.  
4. **Generate JSON:** The scraper outputs a JSON file
